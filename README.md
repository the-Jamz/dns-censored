# UK-Blocking Hosts VPN Routing List

A curated list of websites and services that block or restrict access to UK users, formatted for automatic VPN routing on MikroTik, ControlD, and UniFi devices.

## 📋 About

This project maintains a list of domains that have chosen to block, restrict, or significantly limit access from UK IP addresses, typically in response to the UK Online Safety Act and related regulations.

**Purpose:**
- Track which services are blocking UK users
- Provide transparency about internet fragmentation
- Enable automatic VPN routing for blocked services
- Help users maintain access to services via policy-based routing

## 🎯 Use Case

Unlike traditional DNS blocklists, this project is designed for **VPN routing**. When a domain on this list is accessed, your router will automatically route that traffic through a VPN connection, bypassing UK geo-restrictions.

## 📦 Available Formats

All formats are automatically generated from the source domains list:

- **Domains** (`domains/uk-blocking-hosts.txt`) - Plain domain list (source file)
- **ControlD** (`controld/uk-blocking-hosts.txt`) - ControlD Custom Rules format
- **MikroTik** (`mikrotik/uk-blocking-hosts.rsc`) - RouterOS script for address-lists
- **UniFi/VyOS** (`unifi/uk-blocking-hosts.sh`) - VyOS script for USG domain-groups

## 🔗 Usage

### Direct Links

Choose the format that matches your platform:

```
# Plain domains list (source)
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Jamz/dns-censored/main/domains/uk-blocking-hosts.txt

# ControlD format
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Jamz/dns-censored/main/controld/uk-blocking-hosts.txt

# MikroTik RouterOS script
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Jamz/dns-censored/main/mikrotik/uk-blocking-hosts.rsc

# UniFi/VyOS script
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Jamz/dns-censored/main/unifi/uk-blocking-hosts.sh
```

### Platform-Specific Instructions

#### ControlD

1. Go to ControlD Dashboard > Filters > Custom Rules
2. Create a new folder (e.g., "UK Blocked")
3. Import the ControlD format file or copy domains
4. Set action to **REDIRECT** to route through a specific resolver/VPN endpoint

#### MikroTik RouterOS

1. Download the `.rsc` file or copy the script contents
2. Import via terminal or paste commands directly:
   ```
   /import uk-blocking-hosts.rsc
   ```
3. Create a mangle rule to mark routing:
   ```
   /ip firewall mangle add chain=prerouting dst-address-list=uk-blocked \
     action=mark-routing new-routing-mark=vpn-route passthrough=yes
   ```
4. Add a route using the VPN gateway with the routing mark

#### UniFi Security Gateway (USG)

1. SSH into your USG
2. Copy and paste the script contents or run:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-Jamz/dns-censored/main/unifi/uk-blocking-hosts.sh | bash
   ```
3. Configure policy routing to use the domain-group:
   ```
   set policy route VPN_ROUTE rule 10 destination group domain-group UK_BLOCKED
   set policy route VPN_ROUTE rule 10 set table 1
   ```

**Note**: USG configurations may be overwritten by the controller. Consider using `config.gateway.json` for persistent configuration.

## 📝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you've discovered a site blocking UK users:

1. **Verify the blocking:**
   - Confirm the site is inaccessible from UK IP addresses
   - Test with/without VPN to verify it's location-based
   - Document the error message or blocking notice

2. **Submit evidence:**
   - Open an issue with screenshots or details
   - Include the domain name and date of discovery
   - Note whether it's a complete block or partial restriction

3. **Pull requests:**
   - Add domains to `domains/uk-blocking-hosts.txt` (the source file only)
   - Group domains by service with a comment header (e.g., `# Reddit`)
   - Include both the base domain and www subdomain if applicable
   - Update the entry count in the header
   - Commit only the source file (formats are auto-generated by CI/CD)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## ⚖️ Scope

**Included:**
- Sites that completely block UK access
- Sites that significantly restrict functionality for UK users
- Services that have withdrawn from the UK market due to regulations

**Not included:**
- Sites that merely show cookie/GDPR notices
- Sites with UK-specific terms of service changes but no blocking
- Regional pricing differences
- Content licensing restrictions (e.g., streaming geo-blocks unrelated to OSA)

## 📜 License

See [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## 🔄 Updates

This list is updated as new blocking instances are discovered and verified. All formats include version timestamps for tracking.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This list is provided for informational and transparency purposes. Inclusion on this list indicates observed blocking behavior and does not constitute an endorsement or criticism of any service's decision to block UK traffic.

**Legal Note**: Users are responsible for ensuring their use of VPN routing complies with applicable laws and service terms of service.

## 🛠️ Building

**For Contributors:**

The platform-specific formats (`controld/`, `mikrotik/`, `unifi/`) are **automatically generated by GitHub Actions** and should not be manually edited or committed.

**Workflow:**
1. Edit only `domains/uk-blocking-hosts.txt`
2. Commit and push your changes
3. GitHub Actions automatically builds and commits the platform-specific formats
4. The generated formats are published to the repository

**Local Testing:**

To test format generation locally before committing:

```bash
python3 build.py
```

This generates the formats in their respective directories, but **do not commit these files** - they are in `.gitignore` and will be auto-generated by CI/CD.
